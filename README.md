# Python 15 Day Challenge
Now we move onto popular packages . We'll explore Pandas and Numpy in these 15 days. I hope it is fun. After this anyone would be ready to start with some projects maybe Titanic and other datasets.  
Please Note :
For doing practice on pandas , I've forked https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises repository. Though , I've made some changes in solutions and questions. Feel free to fork any repository to practice questions. 
I would like to thank Guilherme Samora (https://github.com/guipsamora) for making pandas excercises and W3resource for Numpy Excercises. It's really useful for beginners .

Kudos!!
You did it.
Now, you've mastered the basic important packages of Python. No need to memorise the syntax and functions. 
Keep the cheatsheet with you and that's enough else Google is always there for our rescue.
