# Python15DayChallenge
Now we move onto popular packages . We'll explore Pandas and Numpy in these 15 days. I hope it is fun. After this anyone would be ready to start with some projects maybe Titanic and other datasets.  
Please Note :
For doing practice on pandas , I've forked https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises repository. Though , I've made some changes in solutions and questions. Feel free to fork any repsoitory to practice questions. 
I would like to thank Guilherme Samora (https://github.com/guipsamora) for making pandas excercises repository. ..
